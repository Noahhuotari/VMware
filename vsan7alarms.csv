vSAN stretched cluster alarm for 'Site latency' health,"This alarm is triggered if the worst latency between any two hosts in data sites and witness exceed certain limit. Warning threshold: 5ms between/within data sites, 200ms between data site and witness in NON-ROBO cluster, 500ms between data site and witness in ROBO cluster. Check the network between the failed pair of hosts to ensure the network setup meets the minimal requirements. NOTE: The pair of hosts failing in vSAN basic connectivity (small ping) test will be skipped.",
vSAN stretched cluster alarm 'Invalid preferred fault domain on witness host',"The following (witness) hosts have invalid preferred fault domains. The preferred fault domain is utilized by the witness host, and it must be the fault domain of either data site in the vSAN stretched cluster. It cannot be empty. If this alarm is triggered, the vSAN stretched cluster has configuration errors that affect its operation. Refer to Ask VMware KB in vSAN health monitor for more details.",
vSAN stretched cluster alarm 'Invalid unicast agent',This alarm is triggered if the cluster contains hosts with invalid unicast agent. An invalid unicast agent on the host can cause a communication malfunction with the witness hosts. Refer to Ask VMware KB in vSAN health monitor for more details.,
vSAN stretched cluster alarm 'No disk claimed on witness host',"The stretched cluster witness host does not have a valid disk group. If the witness host does not have any disk claimed, its fault domain is not available and vSAN cannot provision any objects with Number of Failures To Tolerate set to one (FTT = 1). Refer to Ask VMware KB in vSAN health monitor for more details.",
vSAN stretched cluster alarm 'Preferred fault domain unset',"The preferred fault domain is not set in the cluster for the witness host. The preferred fault domain is utilized by the witness host, and it must be the fault domain of either data site in the vSAN stretched cluster. It cannot be empty. If this alarm is triggered, the vSAN stretched cluster has configuration errors that affect its operation. Refer to Ask VMware KB in vSAN health monitor for more details.",
vSAN stretched cluster alarm 'Shared witness per cluster component limit scaled down',Checks if the per cluster component limit has been scaled down in shared witness node due to lack of memory.,
vSAN stretched cluster alarm 'Unexpected number of data node in shared witness cluster',Checks if the number of data nodes in a shared witness cluster exceeds 2. The number of data hosts of any stretched cluster with shared witness cannot exceed 2.,
vSAN stretched cluster alarm 'Unexpected number of fault domains',"The stretched cluster does not contain two valid fault domains. Each data site must reside in a different fault domain. The total number of fault domains for data sites must be two. If this alarm is triggered, the vSAN stretched cluster has configuration errors that affect its operation. Refer to Ask VMware KB in vSAN health monitor for more details.",
vSAN stretched cluster alarm 'Unicast agent configuration inconsistent',"The stretched cluster contains multiple unicast agents. This means multiple unicast agents were set on non-witness hosts. If this alarm is triggered, the vSAN stretched cluster has configuration errors that affect its operation. Refer to Ask VMware KB in vSAN health monitor for more details.",
vSAN stretched cluster alarm 'Unicast agent not configured',"Hosts must setup unicast agent so that they are able to communicate with the witness node.
